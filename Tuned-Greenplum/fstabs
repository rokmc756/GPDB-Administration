# XFS is the preferred data storage file system on Linux platforms.
# Use the mount command with the following recommended XFS mount options for RHEL 7 and CentOS systems:
rw,nodev,noatime,nobarrier,inode64

# The nobarrier option is not supported on RHEL 8 or Ubuntu systems. Use only the options:
rw,nodev,noatime,inode64

# See the mount manual page (man mount opens the man page) for more information about using this command.
# The XFS options can also be set in the /etc/fstab file. This example entry from an fstab file specifies
# the XFS options.
/dev/data /data xfs nodev,noatime,inode64 0 0
